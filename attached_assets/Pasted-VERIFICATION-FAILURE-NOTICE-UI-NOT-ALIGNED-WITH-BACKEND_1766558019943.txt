VERIFICATION FAILURE NOTICE – UI NOT ALIGNED WITH BACKEND CLAIMS

Your confirmation is not accepted.

While backend endpoints may return 200, the user-facing Home page does not reflect the required functionality, and Admin uploads still trigger authorization errors at the UI level.

Proceed to correct the following UI-LEVEL FAILURES. These are not backend-only issues.

1. HOME PAGE SECTIONS ARE MISSING (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

Observed Issue (FACTUAL):
The Home page does not display the following required sections:

News Feeds

Videos

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

This is a UI implementation failure, not an API issue.

Required Fix:

Explicitly add UI sections for:

News Feeds

Videos

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

Bind each section to its corresponding public endpoint

Render published content visibly on the Home page

Backend availability without UI rendering does not meet requirements.

2. ADMIN UPLOAD STILL FAILS WITH “AUTHORIZED / UNAUTHORIZED” ERROR

Observed Issue (FACTUAL):

Admin upload actions for News, Videos, and Top Verified still fail

Error occurs at submission from Admin UI

Required Fix:

Ensure Admin upload requests:

Always attach the admin token

Are routed only through admin-protected endpoints

Ensure public endpoints are never reused for admin uploads

Confirm Admin upload success produces:

No authorization errors

Visible confirmation

Persisted data

3. CLAIMED “RESOLVED” STATUS IS INVALID WITHOUT UI PROOF

Clarification:

API returning 200 is not sufficient

“Home page queries execute successfully” is not sufficient

Visible UI sections populated with real content is the acceptance standard

4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This task is considered complete ONLY when:

Admin uploads News / Video / PDF / Top Verified without error

Uploaded content is visible:

Immediately on the Home page

In the correct section

Home page contains all four required sections

No authorization error appears during admin uploads

Public users can view content without login

Until these conditions are met, the system is not operational.

INSTRUCTION

Do not proceed with further verification claims.
Do not state “resolved” again without visible UI confirmation.

Proceed to:

Implement missing Home page sections

Fix Admin UI upload authorization

Re-verify visually, not just via logs
