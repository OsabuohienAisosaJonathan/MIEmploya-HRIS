FINAL CORRECTIVE NOTICE – SYSTEM NOT FUNCTIONAL (BLOCKING ISSUES)

MIEMPLOYA HR WEBSITE

The system is still not operational.
Previous confirmations are invalid based on direct testing.

Proceed to fix the issues below. These are blocking failures.

1. ADMIN UPLOAD – STILL FAILING (UNAUTHORIZED)

Observed (FACT):

Uploading News returns Unauthorized

Uploading Videos returns Unauthorized

Adding Top Verified Candidates returns error

Required Fix:

Admin upload endpoints must:

Accept admin token correctly

Not reject authenticated admin requests

Admin UI must always send the token with uploads

Admin uploads must complete successfully with confirmation

Until uploads work, the content system is broken.

2. SERVICE REQUESTS – NOT APPEARING IN ADMIN DASHBOARD

Observed (FACT):

Public service request form submits

Submission confirmation appears

No requests appear in Admin dashboard

Required Fix:

Ensure service requests:

Are saved to database

Are fetched and displayed in Admin dashboard

Admin dashboard must list:

All submitted requests

Full request details

Uploaded documents

This is a core business function and must work.

3. HOME PAGE – REQUIRED SECTIONS NOT IMPLEMENTED

Observed (FACT):
The Home page contains NONE of the required sections:

News Feeds

Videos

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

Required Fix:
Explicitly implement the following Home page sections:

Latest News Feeds

Training & Announcement Videos

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

Each section must:

Render visibly on the Home page

Pull data dynamically

Display published content

Hide only if no content exists

Backend endpoints without UI sections do not meet requirements.

4. ACCESS CONTROL RULE (RESET & APPLY)

Apply this rule strictly:

Public (No Login):

View Home page

View News, Videos, PDFs, Top Verified

Admin Only:

Upload content

Publish / Unpublish

View service requests

Do not protect public fetch endpoints with admin authorization.

5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (FINAL)

The system is considered working ONLY when:

Admin uploads News, Videos, PDFs, and Top Verified without Unauthorized errors

Service requests submitted publicly appear immediately in Admin dashboard

Home page visibly displays:

News section

Video section

Top Verified section

Public users see content without login

Do not respond with logs or claims.
Respond only after visual UI confirmation of the above.

IMPORTANT

Do not introduce new features

Do not restate backend status

Fix UI + auth + data flow only

This is the final corrective instruction before escalation
