GLOBAL UI / CSS ENHANCEMENT PROMPT – MIEMPLOYA HR WEBSITE

Improve the overall UI and CSS styling of the Miemploya HR website to make it modern, dynamic, and enterprise-grade, while maintaining clarity and professionalism.

Do not change existing functionality, routes, or content logic.
This task is purely visual and UX-focused.

1. BRAND & COLOR SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

Replace the basic color usage with a refined, dynamic palette suitable for an HR & workforce-tech platform.

Primary Colors

Deep Blue (Primary brand anchor)

Teal / Cyan accent (for actions and highlights)

Secondary & Neutral Colors

Soft gray backgrounds for sections

Dark gray / near-black for text

Subtle gradients for hero sections and cards

Rules

Avoid flat single-color backgrounds

Use light gradients or layered backgrounds for depth

Maintain strong contrast for readability

2. TYPOGRAPHY & TEXT HIERARCHY

Improve typography for better visual hierarchy:

Use a modern sans-serif font (e.g. Inter-style look)

Clear size differences between:

Headings

Sub-headings

Body text

Increase line spacing for readability

Slight letter-spacing for headings

Text must feel clean, confident, and professional.

3. CARD & SECTION STYLING (VERY IMPORTANT)

Apply modern card design across:

Service cards

Job cards

News feeds

Top Verified candidates

Templates / Books

Card Design Rules

Rounded corners (soft, not exaggerated)

Subtle shadows (no harsh borders)

Hover effects:

Slight lift

Shadow enhancement

Smooth transition

Clear separation between cards and background

4. BUTTON & INTERACTION DESIGN

Enhance all buttons and interactive elements:

Rounded buttons

Gradient or accent color for primary actions

Subtle hover animations:

Color shift

Soft glow or elevation

Clear distinction between:

Primary buttons (Request Service, Apply, Upload)

Secondary buttons (View Details, Learn More)

Buttons should feel clickable and responsive.

5. PAGE FLOW & SPACING

Improve layout spacing to avoid crowded sections:

Increase vertical spacing between sections

Use alternating background colors or gradients per section

Clearly separate:

Hero

Content sections

Footer

The page should breathe and guide the eye naturally.

6. HEADER & FOOTER ENHANCEMENT
Header

Slight background transparency or gradient

Sticky header behavior (if already implemented)

Clear hover states for menu items

Active page indicator

Footer

Darker background for contrast

Organized columns:

Quick links

Contact info

Social links

Subtle divider lines

Clean typography

7. ANIMATIONS & MICRO-INTERACTIONS (SUBTLE ONLY)

Add light animations:

Fade-in or slide-up on section load

Smooth hover transitions

No heavy or distracting animations

Animations should feel professional, not playful.

8. RESPONSIVENESS & CONSISTENCY

Ensure:

All UI improvements work on mobile and desktop

Cards stack cleanly on smaller screens

Buttons remain accessible

Consistent styling across all pages

9. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete only when:

The website looks visually modern and polished

UI feels dynamic, not flat

Colors, spacing, and typography are consistent

No functionality is broken

The design reflects a serious HR & workforce-tech brand

Do not change business logic or page structure.
Focus only on CSS, styling, and UX polish.
