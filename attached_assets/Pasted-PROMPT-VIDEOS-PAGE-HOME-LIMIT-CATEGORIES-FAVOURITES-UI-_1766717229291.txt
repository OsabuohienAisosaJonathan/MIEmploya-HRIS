PROMPT – VIDEOS PAGE + HOME LIMIT + CATEGORIES + FAVOURITES + UI/CSS (MIEMPLOYA HR)

Implement the following changes for Training & Announcement Videos. These are UI + content-display rules and admin configuration updates. Do not break or change existing routes, APIs, database records, upload logic, or content publishing logic—only extend them.

1) CREATE A DEDICATED PUBLIC PAGE: “Videos”

Add a new public page titled “Videos”.

All videos uploaded by Super Admin must display on this Videos page (100% of published videos).

The Videos page must have a modern, dynamic UI:

Card/grid layout with clean spacing

Video thumbnail/preview + title + category label

Hover effects: subtle lift, shadow, border glow

Smooth transitions and loading skeletons (optional)

Responsive: 3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile

2) HOME PAGE: LIMIT TO 4 VIDEOS ONLY

The Home page must show only 4 videos maximum.

Home page video selection rule:

Only “Favourite” videos are allowed to display on the Home page.

If more than 4 are marked favourite, show only the most recent 4 (or latest 4 by upload date).

Home page must display:

Video title

Video preview/thumbnail

No category label on Home page (category should NOT show on Home page).

Reduce the Home page video height by 40% from the current height while keeping aspect ratio (no stretching).

3) ADMIN VIDEO MANAGEMENT: ADD CATEGORIES + FAVOURITE FEATURE

Restructure the Admin video upload/management section to support classification and Home page selection.

A) Categories (Mandatory)

Add a required “Category” field when uploading/editing a video:

Categories: News, Training, Vacancy, Announcement, Education

Category must be stored with each video.

Category label must display only on the Videos page, not on Home.

B) Favourite Toggle (Mandatory)

Add a “Favourite” toggle/checkbox for each video in Admin.

Favourite videos are the only videos eligible for Home page display.

Admin must be able to:

Mark/unmark favourite

See favourite status in the list/grid

All published videos must still display on the Videos page regardless of favourite status.

4) VIDEOS PAGE FILTERING BY CATEGORY (PUBLIC)

On the Videos page:

Add category filter tabs or a dropdown:

All, News, Training, Vacancy, Announcement, Education

When user clicks a category, show only videos in that category.

If a category has no videos, show a clean empty state message.

5) SCROLL-TO-TOP ON EVERY PAGE NAVIGATION (MANDATORY)

Ensure that every time a user navigates to any new page, the page loads at the top (scroll position resets to top).
This must apply to:

Home → Videos

Videos → other pages

Any menu navigation

6) CSS / UI POLISH FOR VIDEOS (NEW PAGE)

Apply modern CSS enhancements:

Card styling:

Border-radius, soft shadow, gradient accents

Hover:

transform translateY(-4px), shadow deepen, subtle outline

Typography:

clear heading hierarchy

Buttons:

consistent CTA style (“View All Videos”, “Watch” if needed)

Dark mode support (if already added globally):

ensure videos page inherits dark mode variables properly

7) CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Do not change existing functionality, routes, or backend logic.

Do not remove existing admin uploads.

Do not alter publishing logic—only ensure:

“Published” content displays publicly

“Favourite” only controls Home page selection

Ensure video URLs continue to load from bucket storage and remain stable.

8) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

This is complete only when:

“Videos” page exists and shows all published videos.

Home page shows max 4 videos, favourite only, with 40% reduced height.

Admin can assign video category and toggle favourite.

Category labels display only on Videos page.

Videos page has category filters.

Navigating to any page always starts at the top.

UI is modern and responsive with hover effects and clean styling.
