FLOATING CTA BUTTON LAYOUT & SHAPE ADJUSTMENT PROMPT

Adjust the existing floating CTA button with the text “Free Training!!! Register Now.” as follows.
This is a UI / CSS-only adjustment. Do not change functionality, routing, or admin logic.

1. TEXT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
Required Text Layout

Split the text into two lines:

Line 1 (Top):
Free Training!!!

Line 2 (Below):
Register Now

Rules

“Register Now” must appear directly below “Free Training!!!”

Both lines must be:

Center-aligned horizontally

Center-aligned vertically within the button

Maintain the previously applied 150% font size increase

2. BUTTON SHAPE & DIMENSIONS (CRITICAL)
Required Shape

Change the button shape to a horizontal oval (pill-shaped) design

Use full border-radius to achieve a smooth oval appearance

Dimension Requirement

The floating CTA button must:

Match the same height and width as the WhatsApp floating icon currently visible on the page

Maintain consistent padding and proportions

This ensures visual harmony between the CTA and WhatsApp button.

3. FONT & VISUAL CONSISTENCY

The CTA button must:

Use the same font size scale as the WhatsApp floating icon

Maintain bold, readable text

Text color should remain white

Background color should remain the existing CTA accent color

4. POSITION & BEHAVIOR (UNCHANGED)

Keep the button:

Fixed at the bottom-left of the screen

With existing animation behavior (periodic enlargement)

Do not alter:

Click action

Navigation destination

Animation timing logic

5. RESPONSIVENESS

Ensure the two-line text:

Does not overflow the oval container

Scales properly on mobile devices

Maintain clean spacing between the two lines

6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This task is complete only when:

“Free Training!!!” appears on the first line

“Register Now” appears directly below it

Button has an oval (pill) shape

Button matches the WhatsApp floating icon’s height and width

Font size and overall scale are visually consistent

No functionality or animation is broken
