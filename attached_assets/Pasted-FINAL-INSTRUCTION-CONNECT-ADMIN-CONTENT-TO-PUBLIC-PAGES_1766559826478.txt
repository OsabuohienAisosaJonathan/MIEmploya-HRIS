FINAL INSTRUCTION – CONNECT ADMIN CONTENT TO PUBLIC PAGES + ADD TEMPLATES FEATURE

Admin uploads are now working correctly.
However, admin-published content is not displaying on public pages.
Proceed to complete the following items.

1. PUBLIC PAGE DATA BINDING (CRITICAL)
Observed Issue

Admin can upload and publish:

News

Videos

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

Content exists in database

Home page and Top Verified page do not display this content

News Feeds

PDFs / Books

Top Verified Candidates

Each section must:

Fetch data from the correct public API endpoints

Display only published content

Render media correctly (images, videos, PDF links)

Hide automatically if no content exists

Backend availability without UI rendering is not acceptable.

Fetch approved / published Top Verified candidates

Display candidate profile image, name, and profession

Do not require authentication

Must match Admin-published records exactly
