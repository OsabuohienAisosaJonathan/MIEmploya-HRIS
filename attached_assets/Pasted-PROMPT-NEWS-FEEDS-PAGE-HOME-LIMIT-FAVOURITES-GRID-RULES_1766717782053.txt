PROMPT – NEWS FEEDS PAGE + HOME LIMIT + FAVOURITES + GRID RULES + HEADER MENU REORG (MIEMPLOYA HR)

Implement the following changes for Latest News and Header Navigation. These are UI + content-display rules and admin configuration updates. Do not change existing routes, APIs, database structures, upload logic, or publishing logic—only extend them safely.

1) CREATE A DEDICATED PUBLIC PAGE: “News Feeds”

Add a new public page titled “News Feeds”.

All news feeds uploaded by Super Admin must display on this News Feeds page (100% of published news).

Each news card/list item must display:

Featured image (poster)

Title

Short preview snippet

Date posted

“Read More” link/button

2) NEWS DETAILS VIEW (FULL CONTENT PAGE)

When a user clicks a news item on Home page or News Feeds page:

Open a news details view

Display full image (poster) fully and clearly

Display full content text (not truncated)

Keep this purely public UI—Admin workflow must not change.

3) HOME PAGE NEWS SECTION: LIMIT TO 6 POSTS ONLY

Home page must show only 6 news posts maximum.

Selection rule:

Home page must display only Favourite news posts

If more than 6 are marked Favourite, display the latest 6 by created date.

Home page must display:

News image (poster)

Title

Very short snippet (1–2 lines max)

“Read More” CTA

4) HOME PAGE NEWS GRID LAYOUT RULES (STRICT)

On the Home page News section:

Each row must contain 3 news cards (desktop).

Maximum of 2 rows (therefore max 6).

Responsive behavior:

Tablet: 2 per row

Mobile: 1 per row

Reduce the news card media height by 20% from current height.

Reduce the news card width by 40% from current layout width (tighten card width / grid container width) while maintaining alignment and avoiding overflow.

Ensure posters/images display fully inside the card container without distortion:

Use proper scaling (object-fit cover)

Ensure no clipped/half-rendered posters

(Note: Your text said “video height/width” for news; apply these size reductions to the news card featured image container since news uses images.)

5) ADMIN NEWS MANAGEMENT: ADD FAVOURITE FEATURE (MATCH VIDEO LOGIC)

Update Admin News upload/management to include a Favourite toggle like videos.

Add a “Favourite” toggle/checkbox for each News Feed item.

Favourite News = eligible for Home page display.

All published News must still display on “News Feeds” page regardless of favourite status.

Admin must be able to:

Mark/unmark favourite

See favourite status in the admin list/table

6) STORAGE RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Ensure all uploaded News images and content continue to:

Upload to the bucket (persistent object storage)

Save the public URL in the database

Render using that URL on:

Home page

News Feeds page

News Details page

Do not revert to local file paths.

7) TOP VERIFIED: INCREASE PHOTO SIZE BY 30%

Increase the profile photo size on:

Home page Top Verified section

Top Verified page

Increase by 30% while maintaining aspect ratio and clean layout.

Ensure image remains crisp, circular or rounded (as designed), responsive across devices.

8) HEADER REORGANISATION: MENU BUTTON + DROPDOWN LIST

Restructure the header navigation to look more professional and reduce clutter.

A) Always visible on header (main nav)

Keep only these items visible:

Home

About

Services

B) Add a “Menu” button (dropdown)

Add a Menu button on the header that opens a dropdown list containing:

Top Verified

Books & Templates (use this exact label)

Jobs

Videos

News Feeds

Training

Contacts

C) Navigation rules

Do not change existing routes—link dropdown items to existing correct pages.

Menu dropdown must be responsive:

Desktop: dropdown panel

Mobile: slide-down or modal-style menu

Add hover/active states and smooth transitions.

9) SCROLL-TO-TOP ON NAVIGATION (MANDATORY)

Every page a user navigates to must load from the top of the page (reset scroll position).
Apply this to all navigation paths including dropdown items.

10) CSS / UI POLISH FOR NEWS PAGES

Enhance UI without changing content logic:

News Feeds page:

Clean grid layout

Consistent spacing

Hover effects on cards

News Details page:

Large featured image (poster) with professional max height

Readable typography and line spacing

Add subtle animations:

fade-in on load

card hover lift

Ensure dark mode compatibility if dark mode is enabled globally.

11) CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Do not change:

Backend logic

Existing routes/URLs

Publishing rules

Only extend:

Favourite toggles

Public pages

UI layouts and styles

12) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST

This is complete only when:

“News Feeds” page exists and shows all published news.

Home page shows max 6 news posts, favourite only, in a 3x2 grid layout.

Favourite feature works for news like videos.

News details shows full image + full content.

Bucket URLs are used consistently (no broken images).

Top Verified photos are 30% larger.

Header shows only Home/About/Services + Menu dropdown with listed items.

Navigation always starts from top of page.
